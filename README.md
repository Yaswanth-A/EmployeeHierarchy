# EmployeeHierarchy

This project is an ASP.NET Core Web API that implements an employee hierarchy using a SQL graph database. It provides endpoints for retrieving the manager and managed employees for a given employee. Microsoft Entity Framework is used for data access, and the API is documented and accessible through Swagger.

Also developed an endpoint to delete all the existing data and add new data through json file as we can manipulate the data in the graph database.
